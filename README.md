# Central Movie dataBase
Small project

A program that can save a list of nameFiles (of movies in this case).
It can search thought the file to find the name of the movie you wanted and his path.
Imagine you have several disk drives, like this you can easily find where it is, or simply verify that you have a movie stocked somewhere, etc...

Simple visual interface made with java.swing. No plugin used.
